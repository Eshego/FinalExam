FINAL EXAM 

The build is in the FinalExamBuild folder

The player movement script just takes the players horizontal and vertical movement and transforms it based off a multiplication of the input and the speed. I believe the spotlight fits the scene well as it keeps focus on the player. I also designed the room as is to fit the scene provided having 2 walls, lava and a ground for the player to walk on alongside a furnace in the corner of the room.

I made all the textures myself and chose to go with normal mapping in this instance. While I feel bump would have added extra charm to the wall I feel that normal mapping better fit the scene with my given texture.

For the lava I decided to go for the same approach as the assignment 2 where we created a wave. Although I wanted the environment to be darker so that the spotlight would really put the attention on the player. Keeping the scene dark made it so the lava was very difficult to see so I added kind of a glow to the shader making it so it looks like the lava is lit up. I feel this adds to the scene and overall fits nicely. In terms of the wave itself I decided to go with a semi- square wave form while changing things up a bit. My shader basically takes a value for amplitude, speed and frequency. We multiply the time by the speed to get the current updated correct speed for the waves. Next we are gonna multiply our amplitude and using the "step" we are gonna multiply the vertext by the frequency and get the mod of 1. We are then going to multiply it by 1. We do this for both the X and the Z and add them together to get the waves height. Finally we want to get the texture of the lava as well as the emission to create the lava you see on screen. One more thing is there is a Toon Ramp shader very slight addition but we basically take a ramp texture that I created and have a smoothness value to adjust the new output of this shader. To adjust the lavas intensity you can change the speed variable from 0.8 to what I think looks decent is 3.8 and if youre into a more edge like flame you could also change the frequency to 0.34 from 0.23.

For the bloom shader I honestly couldnt figure it out so what is in the project is just the script from class which is not implemented in the scene at all. I decided instead to go for the bonus mark and implement my own Scrolling Texture shader for the walls. The reason I decided to add this is because I like to adjust how the texture is offset at times as when I create them I do not have the wall in mind. This allows me to create an appealing scene through a script which I can easily adjust. How this script basically works is it takes 3 properties the main texture alongside a value for X and Y which I set to a range to give the user a slider to control manually. I then add the maintextures uv to the new x and y slider values in the form of a float2. This adjusts the main textures uv to give it an offset to the texture when adjusting it. Overall I feel that changing up the textures through scrolling added to the environment and allowed me to adjust it into something im proud of.
